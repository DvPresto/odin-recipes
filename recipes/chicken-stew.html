        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's finally stew season, so it's time to get the Instant Pot in full rotation.
            Full Disclosure: I am an Instant Pot evangelist, and I think Robyn's recipes
            on <a href="https://realfoodwholelife.com">realfoodwholelife.com</a> are some of the 
            easiest and tastiest ways to make great use out of the gadget.

        <p>This chicken stew is a straight-forward recipe perfect for dinner on those nights
            when you start to feel a chill in the air. It's also a nice way to get an Italian
            flavor profile into a gluten-free meal plan.</p>
