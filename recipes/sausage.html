<h1>Chinese-Style Sausage</h1>
<img src="../images/gourdet.jpeg" alt="cover image of Everyone's Table by Gregory Gourdet">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is my favorite recipe from Gregory Gourdet's "Everyone's Table," 
    probably because it's the easiest. Gourdet's recipe calls for ground
    dark meat chicken, but I've been using ground turkey with
    great results. These fun, sweet and savory sausage patties are great
    for breakfast or filling out any grab and go meal. In his book,
    Gourdet pairs them with eggs and sauteed greens.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs ground turkey</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 tbsp coconut aminos <em>or substitute with terriyaki sauce</em></li>
        <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1 tsp Chinese five spice</li>
        <li> 3/4 tsp red chile flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp white pepper</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ingredients in a mixing bowl and use a spoon to mix well.</li>
        <li>Continue mixing until the mixture is of one color and a smooth, sticky consistency.</li>
    </ol>
