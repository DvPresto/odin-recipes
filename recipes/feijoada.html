        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the only recipe on the site that I have not made yet, but I'm looking forward
            to trying it.
            I have stared dabbling with the <a href=https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tim_ferriss_the-4-hour-chef_one_pager_slow_carb_diet.pdf>
            Tim Ferriss "Slow-Carb" Diet</a>, which looks a lot like my standard
            Protein-Veg-Starch diet, but replaces your standard starches with beans and lentils.
            I went hunting for some fun bean-based recipes to try out and found this one.

        <p>This dish is a hack of a hack. Feijoada is a Brazilian dish that is typically made with pork.
            The recipe in "The Intolerant Gourmet" is a vegan version served over rice. My take
            is to skip the rice and just have the beans and sauce as a fun protein-packed side."
