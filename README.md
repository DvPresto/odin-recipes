This website is a project built by Devin Preston while woring on courses through the Odin Project

Link to project description:
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes

The page contains an index with links to 3 recipes and demonstrates skills in basic html structure and content.

On a personal note, it was a fun project for me to collect and curate the recipes that feel important or valuable to me in this moment.
